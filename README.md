### Introduction:
A repository for ML algorithms usefull for physics, quantum chemistry, materials science.
This is meant to be used as a collection of tutorials.
Therefore complexity of the code and dependencies should be kept to minimum.

### Topics:
* `ml-iap`: machine learning inter-atomic potentials
